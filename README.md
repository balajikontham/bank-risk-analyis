# Bank Risk Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing bank risk by examining loan application data. The analysis helps in understanding risk factors and making data-driven decisions in the banking sector.

## Project Structure

```

└── code.ipynb                # Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
```

## Datasets

1. **application_data.csv**
   - Contains current loan application data
   - Includes various features about applicants and their loan requests

2. **previous_application.csv**
   - Historical data of previous loan applications
   - Useful for analyzing patterns in loan approvals/rejections

3. **columns_description.csv**
   - Provides detailed descriptions of columns in the datasets
   - Essential for understanding the data dictionary
